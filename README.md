# Futose

Ready-to-go JS all-around stack to build web sites. **Not nearly ready for production use, just finding the way around.** These  hipster technologies and libraries are being used right now.

- [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) to maintain infrastructure
- [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/) and [Express](http://expressjs.com) to power server side
- [Stylus](http://learnboost.github.io/stylus/) for CSS
  - [Jeet](https://jeet.gs) as a grid system 
  - [Spritesmith](https://github.com/Ensighten/spritesmith) to craft sprites
- [Fb-flo](https://github.com/facebook/fb-flo) to live reload JS/CSS in the browser
- [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/) to pack it all up for the browser

- [ReactJS](http://facebook.github.io/react/) for both client and server rendering
  - [react-nested-router](https://github.com/rpflorence/react-nested-router) for routing

See all other goodies in [package.json](./package.json).

Probably some of them (React) might be made optional/replacable in the future.

`npm install` to get all dependencies.

`gulp` or `node_modules/.bin/gulp` to begin developing.
